a) Why did you choose the medium you chose?

I chose the medium of Canvas-based Data visualization because I have a practical use for it for a client. He has handed me his paper-based survey analysis program and requests that when I'm ready, I could turn it into a potential premium based product. This is a starting point, and not all the questions were entered for the sake of length in the assignment. I also find visualizing data to be one of the most important features in the business world, and I also have interest in using this skill for personal leisure.


b) What did you know about the medium when you chose it?

I knew pretty much nothing about this medium before I chose it. I mentioned my thought on creating graphs to a third year programming student before and he mentioned chart.js may be a great start, so I took this opportunity to try it. We used canvases briefly before in school so some of the concepts became familiar but overall I was brand new to this.


c) What are all the resources (web pages, tutorials, videos, etc.) that you used to help you?

1) Chart.js

4) Google: Stack Overflow, MDN


d) What was the most challenging part of the assignment, and how did you overcome it?
The beginning was a challenge because setting up the node application was causing me loads of problems, wasn't able to get the application to be even be compatible with my computer. I worked past this by learning about the CDN links that I can just plug into my code like any other CSS or Javascript link.

Learning how to customize the graph charts were at times challenging, and unfortunately my customization was limited because of time purposes. I would have liked to be more comfortable creating free custom code rather than editing a few words and sections here and there because I'm afraid to break everything.

What I am happy about that I did on my own is that I wanted my graphs to read from user input on the page. I could not find any useful help with this online at all for some reason. I figured out how to create the variables and replace them in the code on my own.
