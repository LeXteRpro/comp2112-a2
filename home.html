		<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Growing teams: The Amarylliss Way is one of the four key elements in the Amaryllis Way Training System. It is a philosophy of leadership that seeks to understand how to nurture a team so it thrice. It is the process of understanding the individuals on your team and the teamâ€™s unique DNA.</p>

			<p><em>Growing Teams is a personal inventory and team-profiling tool, and the companion to the book The Amaryllis Way, Growing Leaders Who Grow Leaders, a leadership parable that describes a philosophy of leadership. In my book the Amaryllis Way, I share a parable about failing manager who learns to treat people like plants and turns his leadership life around in the process. Using horticultural metaphors found in scripture, I compare growing people to growing plants. Growing leaders does not begin by taking a course, or taking a bunch of principles and forcing them on people. Leadership begins in quiet surrender to the almighty God. If you really want to make a difference, start by drawing a circle around yourself and praying that God will grow everything in that circle.</em></p>
